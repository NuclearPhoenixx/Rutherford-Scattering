# Rutherford Scattering

This simulation numerically solves the coupled differential equation for two charged particles interacting only via Coulomb's law.
The resulting interaction is commonly known as Rutherford scattering or Coulomb scattering.

Standard values represent a Proton being fired at a gold nucleus representing the famous Geigerâ€“Marsden experiment (also known as Rutherford gold foil experiment).

**Attention:**

* _Particle proportions (i.e. atom/particle circle sizes) are not to scale._
* _Distances have been scaled up by a factor of 10^15._
* _By default, the time scale has been scaled down by a factor of 10^21. This can be changed in-sim._
